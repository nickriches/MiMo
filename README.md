# MiMo

Please visit [https://nickriches.shinyapps.io/MiMo/](https://nickriches.shinyapps.io/MiMo/) to try out the app. There are full instructions included in the app. It should only take about ten minutes to do some basic analysis.

NB If the app does not work I may have used up all the bandwidth on my shinyapps account. Apologies in advance for this - I don't have the resources to pay for the full professional account.

**Installing to a shinyapps.io server**

This github site contains the code for the MiMo language app. To get this up and running on a shinyapps.io server, here's what you need to do...

(1) Install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) on a computer

(2) Join [Shiny Apps](https://www.shinyapps.io/) and set up a Free Account.

(3) Create a Shiny Apps Project in RStudio (New Project > New Directory > Create Shiny Web Appilcation > Create Project)

(4) Download the above files into your Shiny Apps directory (using the green "Download" button), making sure you write over any existing files with the same name.

(5) Upload your App to Shiny Apps (using the blue symbol at the top right hand corner of your screen)

**Running the app locally**

You may also choose to run your app locally without installing to a server. To do this, (a) make sure that all of the files in the .www folder are copied and pasted into the main folder, (b) select all of the text in the app.R file, and run.

The Free Account has a limited number of active hours, and if the app is being heavily used you may need to take out a paid plan. Alternatively, the Shiny Framework can be downloaded to any server free of charge. You may find someone at your institution has already set up their own shiny server.
