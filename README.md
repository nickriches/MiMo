# MiMo

Please visit [https://nickriches.shinyapps.io/MiMo/](https://nickriches.shinyapps.io/MiMo/) to try out the app. There are full instructions included in the app. It should only take about ten minutes to do some basic analysis.

NB If the app does not work I may have used up all the bandwidth on my shinyapps account. Apologies in advance for this - I don't have the resources to pay for the full professional account.

This github site contains the code for the MiMo language app. To get this up and running, here's what you need to do...

(1) Install R and RStudio on a computer

(2) Join  [Shiny Apps](https://www.shinyapps.io/) and set up a Free Account.

(3) Create a Shiny Apps Project in RStudio.

(4) Copy and paste the code in the App.R file on Github into the App.R file which is created in your Shiny Apps Project.

(5) Upload your App to Shiny Apps (using the blue symbol at the top right hand corner of your screen)

For more resources on how to use Shiny Apps go to [https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/)

The Free Account has a limited number of active hours, and if the app is being heavily used you may need to take out a paid plan. Alternatively, the Shiny Framework can be downloaded to any server free of charge. You may find someone at your institution has already set up their own shiny server.
